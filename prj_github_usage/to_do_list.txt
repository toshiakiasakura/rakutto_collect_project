### to do list ### 

# git and gitHub is totally different thing.  
clarify the difference. ( using graph? or command ? ) 

# how to compare jupyter notebook files easily. 
(jupyter notebook automatically create json object, 
so that many humble codes appears.
Ideally, if code chuncks are only be extracted and 
compare difference, it is good thing.) 

# how to share git system without github.
(suppose use git individually) 
ex. start git in asakura's computer. 
and share that directory with others. 
then how to integrate different version of git. 


# list up useful git command, 
and if some commands are frequently used, 
register them as alias (both git alias and bash alias is ok. ) 

# ticket function should exist, find out that function. 
use other services, ex. reddit ?.
